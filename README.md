# Reusable sign up form

A form which you could use in many different projects as I have in my 
[Bookary](https://github.com/YasinYunesi/Bookary) project. This form is validated using
the React-hook-form library which is an amazingly comlpete library and I've used 
tailwind CSS to style this reusable Sign up / Login form.

## Technologies

 - React JS (Javascript library)
 - React-hook-form (Form validation)
